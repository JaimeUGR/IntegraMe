# IntegraMe
IntegraMe is a schedule for students in special education centers, developed for children with
different capabilities and capacities.

## Where it comes from
In the subject project leading & management, we had been taught about accesibility and software project's
development, which we put to use developing this application as the main subject's task.


## The app
This application was developed for Android. 

Technology wise, it was created with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, as we believe that these are the best
tools that nowadays exist for Android.

## The backend
The application's backend was made using NodeJS as the server, where we defined a REST json based
API that communicates the database and the frontend, which in this case is our Android app.
